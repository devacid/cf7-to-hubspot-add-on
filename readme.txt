This plugin integrates HubSpot forms with Contact Form 7 forms.

== Description ==
This is a plugin which seamlessly integrates HubSpot forms with Contact Form 7 forms.

Once installed and activated, each CF7 form will have a separate settings section where you can add HubSpot form credentials. i.e, Portal ID, Form ID, Form Fields, etc.

Once the plugin is activated you will have the option to enable/disable the form integration. In enabled mode, the status code and response from HubSpot will be stored for the last form submission so you can debug if there are any issues.

Note: This plugin uses the PHP library cURL. Please make sure that the cURL library is enabled on your server.
